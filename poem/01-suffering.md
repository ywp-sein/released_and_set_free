# Suffering

If suffering hasn't purified my heart,<br>
please let me remain in it.<br>
I don't want to seek the fleeting spark in the darkness;<br>
I yearn for the eternal light to shine upon me.

If suffering hasn’t cleansed my heart as a mirror<br>
Please let me dwell a little longer<br>
I don’t want to hide the light under my own bushel<br>
I long to reflect the light and warmth of the pillar of fire I witnessed in the dark wilderness

If suffering is the path I am called to walk,<br>
Please teach me how to find joy within it.<br>
I don’t want to veil Your glory<br>
I burn to hallow Your name with all that I am.
