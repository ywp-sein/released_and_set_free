# To What Extent Should I Keep Asking?

*Written in 2024.03.19*


People often ask God about matters. If one asks in spirit and in truth for the sake of truth, the Holy Spirit will surely guide during the process of prayer. And sometimes, when praying and asking, the Holy Spirit reveals the true issue behind a question, and even further, exposes yet another issue behind that.

So perhaps one may ask: To what extent should I keep asking?

I had this very question, so today I asked Father:

I asked, “How far should I go in asking about one matter in prayer?”<br>
He answered, “Until the answer points entirely to Me.”

>Psalm 27:4<br>
>“One thing I have asked of the Lord,<br>
>this is what I seek:<br>
>that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,<br>
>to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord,<br>
>and to seek Him in His temple.”

Prayer is to keep asking until you discover that you are already dwelling in His temple.
At that moment, the answers you receive to your questions are truly the truth.
