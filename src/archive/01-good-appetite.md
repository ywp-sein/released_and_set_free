# Good Appetite

*Written in 2023.06.09*

Once a prodigal son who returned said:<br>
>We don't react to the situation.<br>
>We don't react to our feelings.<br>
>We react to the Word of God.

When a relative of mine passed away, my company boss expressed his condolences to me. He also said that he hoped humanity would one day discover the code to possess a body of eternal life.

I was a little surprised when I heard it. My boss is a talkative man, so I didn’t reply much at the time. My surprise wasn’t because of his words, but because God let me hear those words. The reflections they stirred in me became a great comfort.

Later, I smiled inwardly and said:<br>
“I’ve already found the code, and even have the decoding book—and what’s more, I can read it.”

Then the Holy Spirit said to me:<br>
“I will teach you how to read this book, and I will also have you teach others to read it. The method is super simple: **just ask Me**.”

So it is also with trials.
What is a trial? What exactly is being tested?
A trial is when, during the test, one gives up trying to find the answer on their own and instead asks the Examiner directly.

This is very important, so let me repeat it:<br>
 **Give up trying to find the answer on your own—just ask the Examiner.**

Isaiah 55:1–2 says:
>“Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters;<br>
>and you who have no money, come, buy and eat!<br>
>Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.<br>
>Why spend money on what is not bread,<br>
>and your labor on what does not satisfy?<br>
>Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good,<br>
>and you will delight in the richest of fare.”

Without paying a cent, by simply listening carefully to God’s Word, we can eat what is good. Even in the presence of our enemies He prepares a feast—we are only responsible to eat, to rejoice in our hearts. And as we eat and rejoice, we naturally remind others to join the feast as well.

The son I mentioned at the beginning (yes, no longer a prodigal son but a son now) also said:
“If God says the liquid before me is wine, then even if I feel it is water, I will say it is wine.”

This is a great reminder.

Even if we feel we are not His children—if the Father says we are, then we are. No objections.
Even if we are disturbed by the things in front of us—we must not believe in our circumstances or our emotions. **We only need to respond to God’s Word**.

**Seek truth through grace, confirm grace through truth.** By the Spirit given to us, each day become more like our Lord, and draw closer to the Father who loves us.

Everything flows from His love.

So we should boldly say to God as His children:
“Papa, whatever You want to give me, I want it all (to eat)!”

May we all become children with a good appetite.
