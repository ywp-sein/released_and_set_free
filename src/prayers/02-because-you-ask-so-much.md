# Because You Ask So Much 

*Written in 2024.01.19*

Sometimes we wonder whether God has heard our prayers, because it feels like there is no response. God knows all of our prayers and answers every one of them—it’s just that many times His answer is not in the way we want.

**No response?**<br>
The greatest reason we feel God hasn’t responded is that we are not fixing our eyes on Him.

For those who feel He hasn’t responded—perhaps the noise of the world around you is too loud, and you have not quieted yourself enough.

For those who feel He hasn’t responded—perhaps you haven’t invited the Holy Spirit often enough to read the Word together with you.

For those who feel He hasn’t responded—perhaps your prayers need adjusting, because you haven’t begun by asking about the most important things.

For most people who feel He hasn’t responded—all of the above are true.

**Waiting**<br>
Of course, sometimes He also makes us wait. When He wants us to wait, He will make it clear during the ongoing process of prayer that waiting is necessary.

Because prayer is about seeking His will.

There are many stories of waiting in the Bible, but their waiting was never passive.
Noah waited for the rain for 120 years, yet he never stopped building the ark.

From God’s perspective,<br>
Was He, through Noah building the ark, warning people to repent?<br>
Was He giving people time to repent?<br>
Or was He waiting for Noah to finish the ark?

The way I understand it is this: in fact, He is the One waiting for us.
And while we wait, it’s not about doing nothing—it’s about being trained, being strengthened, learning to fix our eyes on Him continually.
That is how we truly find strength in Him.
And in the process of waiting, we also become an example to others.

Then, at the best moment when everything is ready, He grants us the promise.

**Too many words**<br>
Recently I heard a sixty-something chemist share that when he was nineteen, he cried and pleaded, saying he had never heard the Lord’s voice and wanted the Lord to speak to him. And the Lord did speak to him in various ways, especially through Scripture. From then on, whenever he couldn’t find God’s will, he would “make a fuss” until God gave him a “piece of candy.”

Our Father actually delights in speaking with His children, and He loves it when His children talk with Him. So, if we want to hear Him speak to us, we just have to keep knocking—keep fussing until we “get candy.”

Once I even said to the Father: “Father, You talk so much.”<br>
He answered: “Because you ask so much.”<br>
Me: “Haha.” (silly laugh)

It feels almost like getting a sugar rush.
