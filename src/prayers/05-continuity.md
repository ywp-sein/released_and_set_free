# Continuity

*Written in 2025.08.27*

Before, during prayer, I found myself saying, “Lord, please teach us to enter Your peace.” And a question arose in my heart: why must we enter it again and again? Can we not simply abide in Your peace and remain there, instead of constantly oscillating and feeling double-minded? This reminded me of being filled with the Spirit—why can’t we be filled continuously, at all times?

At the same time, a Scripture came to mind: “Keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life” (Jude 1:21). It seems we are called to maintain a posture of abiding in Him, a continuous state of remaining in His presence. **Continuity in His presence is essential.**

I have asked God to teach me how to keep myself in His love and never stray. Regarding the prayer to enter, I long to continually enter **deeper** peace, a **deeper** understanding of Him, and a **fuller** comprehension of His holy love. I do not want to be distracted or step out of this process. By His grace, I simply believe that I cannot—because He is always holding me, and I know it.

>Isaiah 46:3-4<br>
>“Listen to Me, O house of Jacob,<br>
>And all the remnant of the house of Israel,<br>
>Who have been upheld by Me from birth,<br>
>Who have been carried from the womb:<br>
>Even to your old age, I am He,<br>
>And even to gray hairs I will carry you!<br>
>I have made, and I will bear;<br>
>Even I will carry, and will deliver you.

Amen!
