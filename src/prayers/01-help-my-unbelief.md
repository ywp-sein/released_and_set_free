# Help My Unbelief

Jesus said to the child's father, whose son is possessed by an unclean spirit, “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.” (Mark 9:23)

And when we feel lacking in faith for the things we do, the father of the sick child shows us the perfect example:

Immediately the child’s father cried out (some manuscripts: immediately cried out with tears),
“I believe! Help my unbelief.” (Mark 9:24)

I believe:
If a person truly cries out in spirit and in truth like this,
if one still holds on to faith from God, then one can continue forward.

I have cried out,<br>
and I have even prayed such prayers.

I have asked the Lord:<br>

>The things You want me to do,<br>
>please give me sufficient faith and courage to do them;<br>
>the things You do not want me to do,<br>
>please remove them from my heart—may they not even enter it.

I believe in my prayer, and I also believe this is a prayer taught by the Holy Spirit.
For the Lord has given me sufficient faith and courage, to believe in this very prayer I prayed as the first step.

P.S. I have to say that this prayer has a very interesting recursive logic.
