# Truth or Consequence: The Final Separation 

As the fullness of Truth continues to unfold, the division between those who receive it and those who reject it will become increasingly evident. Only those who stand with the Truth will be able to perceive this; the rest will remain in confusion.

I believe there is only one Church, one Body. Every saint throughout history—past and present—is a part of this Body, each contributing to the understanding of Truth through their lives and testimonies. This also means that when the final member of this Body is made ready, the Church will be complete—the Bride will be prepared.

All of human history is a process of refining and testing humanity’s understanding of the one Truth. Each generation's examination and experience have deepened and solidified its foundation. Therefore, in the days ahead, rejecting the Truth will require a remarkable degree of willful ignorance—an active denial in the face of overwhelming revelation. And those who do so will have to bear the consequences.

The pricetag of rejection is increasing—and it is irreversible.

Come to Truth.

As the fullness of Truth continues to unfold, the division between those who receive it and those who reject it will become increasingly evident (Luke 12:51–53; John 3:19–21). Only those who stand with the Truth will be able to perceive this; the rest will remain in confusion (1 Corinthians 2:14; 2 Corinthians 4:3–4).

I believe there is only one Church, one Body (Ephesians 4:4–6). Every saint throughout history—past and present—is a part of this Body, each contributing to the understanding of Truth through their lives and testimonies (Hebrews 11:39–40; Revelation 12:11). This also means that when the final member of this Body is made ready, the Church will be complete—the Bride will be prepared (Revelation 19:7–8; Ephesians 5:25–27).

All of human history is a process of refining and testing humanity’s understanding of the one Truth (Daniel 12:10; Malachi 3:2–3). Each generation's examination and experience have deepened and solidified its foundation (Romans 15:4; 2 Timothy 3:16–17). Therefore, in the days ahead, rejecting the Truth will require a remarkable degree of willful ignorance—an active denial in the face of overwhelming revelation (Romans 1:18–21; 2 Thessalonians 2:9–12). And those who do so will have to bear the consequences (Hebrews 10:26–27; John 12:48).

The pricetag of rejection is increasing—and it is irreversible (Hebrews 12:25–29; Revelation 22:11–12).

Come to Truth.
