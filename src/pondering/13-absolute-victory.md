# Absolute Victory

Recently, I’ve realized that the key to spiritual warfare is simple and powerful: believe with confidence that Christ is risen and has already won.

Satan and his demons are nothing but foolish losers—defeated once and for all.

How do they attack? Through lies.<br>
But when we refuse to believe the lies of a loser, every foothold is shut.<br>
Even their attacks can be turned into blessings for us.

Some may warn, “Be careful—don’t underestimate their power.”<br>
But the truth remains: they are losers, and they will always be losers.

Our stance is secure: the battle belongs to the Lord.<br>
We trust Him—knowing that even in pain and sorrow, He provides hope, joy, and goodness for His beloved children.<br>
God allows trials, but He also gives us direct access to His strength, His hope, and His joy through Jesus Christ, making us stronger.

It is DONE.<br>
We are winners.<br>
They are losers.

And what we experience in this life is all being shaped to become more and more like our Savior, as preparation for eternity.
