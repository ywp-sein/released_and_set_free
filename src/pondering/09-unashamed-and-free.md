# Unashamed and Free

When I fully surrender to God,<br>
my enemies are no longer dealing with me—<br>
they are facing the Mighty God.<br>
Oops for them, and I don’t feel sorry.<br>
They are foolishly fighting against my Father in Heaven.

Truly, the battle belongs to the Lord.<br>
This is the real peace given to His children—<br>
a peace no one can counterfeit.

Once we surrender to God,<br>
the desire to please people fades.<br>
We live to glorify God alone.

No more pressure to meet social expectations.<br>
No more morality defined by human approval.<br>
No more fear of man.

Fear God—not as being scared of Him,<br>
but as being terrified of living without His presence.<br>

The Truth Himself—<br>
the absolute standard for all ages—<br>
becomes the unshakable foundation of our lives,<br>
our everything.

And above all, He is a loving Father.

I am unashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ,<br>
my Lord and Savior.
