# Unique in His Eyes

When one awakens to the truth<br>
that he or she is created in the image of God,

and when the children of God remember<br>
that they are one body through all of history,

then comparison fades—<br>
since each has equal worth in God.

Competition falls silent—<br>
since all belong to one body, not rivals.

And lies with hidden motives lose their power—
since unity and truth prevail through the Holy Spirit.<br>

For each soul shines as unique in His gaze<br>
and every child of God becomes<br>
a strength, a shelter,<br>
a gift of support to the other.
