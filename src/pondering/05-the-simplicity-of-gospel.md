# The Simplicity of Gospel

The hardest part of believing the Gospel is this—accepting that it’s really that simple. It’s a free gift.

From start to finish, the Christian life is a battle against the lie that it must be more complicated. The moment we add "self," especially self-effort, the power drains away, and the burden begins.

The Holy Spirit only fills a surrendered heart. All goodness flows from Him. And when we call our own efforts “good,” we attempt to rob the glory that belongs to God alone.

Fruit grows naturally when we truly believe—and only God can make it grow. If we strain to produce it, the problem is not the fruit, but the root.

Surrender to the Spirit. Do not hand control to the flesh. Believe it is Christ in us who does all the good.

It’s simple: acknowledge that He does it all.

This is why He calls us to childlike faith.

The hardest part of believing the Gospel is this—accepting that it’s really that simple. It’s a free gift (Ephesians 2:8–9; Romans 6:23).

From start to finish, the Christian life is a battle against the lie that it must be more complicated (Galatians 3:1–3). The moment we add "self," especially self-effort, the power drains away, and the burden begins (Matthew 11:28–30).

The Holy Spirit only fills a surrendered heart (James 4:7–8). All goodness flows from Him (John 15:4–5; Galatians 5:22–23). And when we call our own efforts “good,” we attempt to rob the glory that belongs to God alone (Isaiah 42:8; 1 Corinthians 1:29–31).

Fruit grows naturally when we truly believe—and only God can make it grow (1 Corinthians 3:6–7; John 15:8). If we strain to produce it, the problem is not the fruit, but the root (Jeremiah 17:7–8).

Surrender to the Spirit. Do not hand control to the flesh (Romans 8:5–9; Galatians 5:16–17). Believe it is Christ in us who does all the good (Philippians 2:13; Galatians 2:20).

It’s simple: acknowledge that He does it all (Psalm 115:1).

This is why He calls us to childlike faith (Matthew 18:3; Mark 10:15).
