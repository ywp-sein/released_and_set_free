# Beyond Knowing

If we do not know how to apply knowledge according to its true nature, the only thing left is to show off the piece of information we have—merely showing off.

A.W. Tozer once asked, 
>*“If you do not believe something to the extent that you appropriate it in your life, do you really believe it?” *

In the same way, knowledge that is not lived out remains empty.

Information is not the same as knowledge, and knowledge is not the same as wisdom. Wisdom comes when knowledge is rightly applied, and it is wisdom—not information—that enables people to make sound decisions and live with integrity.

Tozer captured this truth with another reminder: 
>*“The Bible exhorts us to walk in the light. But the light has no value whatsoever unless we are walking in it.”*

Information is not equal to knowledge.<br>
Knowledge is not equal to wisdom.<br>
**We need people to make wise decisions and act with integrity.**
