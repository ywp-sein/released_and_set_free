# The Necessity of Right Judgment

“There is no perfect church,” they said.
“That is not an excuse to stop walking on the path toward perfection,” I answered.

“Who are you to judge? Judge not,” they said.
“And who are you to judge me by saying, ‘Who are you to judge?’” I answered.

We are constantly discerning what is true and what is false; this, in itself, is a form of judgment. The real question is not whether we judge, but whether we judge according to God’s standard. To deny that we judge is both self-deceptive and an evasion of responsibility. It blinds us to truth, robs us of wisdom, and dulls our spiritual vision instead of sharpening it.
