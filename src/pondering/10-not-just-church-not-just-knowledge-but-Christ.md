# Not Just Church, Not Just Knowledge—But Christ

One can go to church every week, even hold titles, or even know a lot about Christianity—and still not be a Christian.

A true Christian has a personal relationship with Christ by following Him—not following laws and rules, but following Christ Himself. He said, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments”. Notice that He did not say, “If you keep my commandments, then you will love me.” It is Christ who fulfills the law, not our deeds. 

**Obeying His commands is the evidence of our love for Him, not the condition for it.** 

This also means that even if outwardly someone seems to be doing many Christian things, inwardly those actions can still be for selfish reasons. If what we do is not truly for Him, it is in vain.

It is His Spirit dwelling in us that enables us to do what is good. That is why it is written that His commands are not burdensome. We are His handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for good works.

And how do we love Him more? By knowing more deeply how much He first loved us.

One can go to church every week, even hold titles, or even know a lot about Christianity—and still not be a Christian (Matthew 7:21–23).

A true Christian has a personal relationship with Christ by following Him—not following laws and rules, but following Christ Himself (John 10:27). He said, “If you love me, you will keep my commandments” (John 14:15). Notice that He did not say, “If you keep my commandments, then you will love me.” It is Christ who fulfills the law, not our deeds (Romans 8:3–4). 

**Obeying His commands is the evidence of our love for Him, not the condition for it (1 John 5:2–3).** 

This also means that even if outwardly someone seems to be doing many Christian things, inwardly those actions can still be for selfish reasons. If what we do is not truly for Him, it is in vain (Matthew 6:1; Colossians 3:23).

It is His Spirit dwelling in us that enables us to do what is good (Philippians 2:13; Galatians 5:16-18). That is why it is written that His commands are not burdensome (1 John 5:3). We are His handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for good works (Ephesians 2:10).

And how do we love Him more? By knowing more deeply how much He first loved us (1 John 4:19; Romans 5:8).
