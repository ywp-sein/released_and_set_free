# Released and Set Free

> Psalm 105:18-20<br>
They bruised his feet with shackles,
his neck was put in irons, till what he foretold came to pass,
till the word of the Lord proved him true. The king sent and released him,
the ruler of peoples set him free.

And indeed, indeed,
"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. "
2 Corinthians 3:17

I never imagined the day would come when I would pour my thoughts into words, giving voice to the gifts I have received. Yet somehow, it happenedâ€”and I can almost hear the Father laughing with joy.

"Write down My glory," He said.

"Okay :)", I replied.
