# Surpassing Expectation

When reality falls short of our longing,<br>
our hearts may grow weary, tempted to expect less.<br>
But could that be the whisper of a lie—<br>
that we should shrink our hope to fit what we see? 

What if, instead, the moments that seem most impossible,<br>
we dared to lift our hopes higher still— <br>
not on the frail wings of human wishing,<br>
but on the unshakable promises of His Word?<br>
What if the boundless goodness we know of Him<br>
became the canvas for the brightest vision our hearts can hold? 

In His Word are treasures without end—<br>
 promise upon promise,<br>
 blessing upon blessing,<br>
 shining not as distant dreams,<br>
 but as gifts the Father longs to place in His children’s hands.

And so, with faith in Him, these words are spoken:<br>
all are received, all are embraced. 

For this is certain: <br>
the reality of His children, in His hands, <br>
will never bow to mere expectation —<br>
it will rise, it will surpass. <br>
His blessings overflow the borders of imagination,<br>
and that is His amazing grace. 


-----

And so, I believe, and therefore I speak:<br>
I have them all already, through faith in Him.<br>
With my loving Father God, all things are possible.
