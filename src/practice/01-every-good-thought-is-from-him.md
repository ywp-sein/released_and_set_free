# Practice: Every Good Thought is from Him

The practice is: **when any thoughts come into our mind and we think they are good, give credit to God, not ourselves.**

Because “every good and perfect gift is from above” (James 1:17), what we think is good is from Him. Every idea, intention, and virtue that shines forth is not our personal achievement, but a gift and offering from God. Following Paul’s teaching to “take every thought captive to obey Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5), the practice involves placing each thought into the light: good thoughts are from God, while what is harmful or misleading comes from ourselves or from the enemy. In doing so, weaknesses are revealed, yet at the same time, God’s greatness becomes clearer and humbles us.

Sometimes, what first appears good may later prove to be mixed with hidden evil. In these moments, God’s Word becomes the standard by which truth is separated from deception (Romans 12:2). This is not a discouragement but an invitation to see more deeply into God’s wisdom. Such discernment naturally gives birth to gratitude. When the heart understands that every good thing is grace, and not the fruit of personal striving, thanksgiving flows freely (1 Thessalonians 5:18).

This even shows how we can actually rejoice always. Discerning whether a thought is good or evil in our mind is itself good, which means even the discernment of good or evil is from God. To know something is good is good; to know something is evil is also good.

That’s why in every circumstance there is a reason to thank God. As long as we don’t escape reality, we are always judging good and evil for ourselves. And the confirmation of knowing good from God itself is a prayer, so constantly discerning good or evil with God is praying without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Through this, we know God is with us and lavishes His goodness on us in every circumstance, and we can have joy (Philippians 4:4). Continuous prayer and discernment make it possible to rejoice at all times, for even in trial, His hand can be seen (Psalm 34:1).

Happiness, sadness, and pain—such emotions are passive reflections of what we have believed or experienced. We cannot control our emotions because they are a natural reflection. But we can choose to rejoice, because it is an active choice of faith: to give glory to God for all the good.


*Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good;* <br>
*Blessed is the man who trusts in Him!*<br>
*Psalm 34: 8*
