# Practice: Every Good Thought is from Him

>**When any thoughts come into our mind and we think they are good, give credit to God, not ourselves.** 

This practice helps us cultivate gratitude toward God and to actively choose joy, as His grace works in our hearts.

Because “every good and perfect gift is from above” (James 1:17), what we think is good is from Him. Every idea, intention, and virtue that shines forth is not our personal achievement, but a gift and offering from God. Following Paul’s teaching to “take every thought captive to obey Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5), the practice involves placing each thought into the light: good thoughts are from God, while what is harmful or misleading comes from ourselves or from the enemy. In doing so, weaknesses are revealed, yet at the same time, God’s greatness becomes clearer and humbles us.

Sometimes, what first appears good may later prove to be mixed with hidden evil. In these moments, God’s Word becomes the standard by which truth is separated from deception (Romans 12:2). This is not a discouragement but an invitation to see more deeply into God’s wisdom. Such discernment naturally gives birth to gratitude. When the heart understands that every good thing is grace, and not the fruit of personal striving, thanksgiving flows freely (1 Thessalonians 5:18).

This even shows how we can actually rejoice always. Discerning whether a thought is good or evil in our mind is itself good, which means even the discernment of good or evil is from God. To know something is good is good; to know something is evil is also good, because God gives us the ability to see clearly and choose rightly.

That’s why in every circumstance, there is always a reason to thank God, as long as we don’t escape the reality that we are continually discerning good and evil for ourselves. The very confirmation of recognizing what is good from God is itself a form of prayer, so constantly discerning good or evil with Him is praying without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Through this practice, we become aware that God is with us, lavishing His goodness in every circumstance, and we can experience true joy (Philippians 4:4). Continuous prayer and discernment make it possible to rejoice at all times, for even in trials, His hand is clearly seen (Psalm 34:1).

Happiness, sadness, and pain—such emotions are passive reflections of what we have believed or experienced. We cannot control our emotions because they are a natural reflection. But we can choose to rejoice, because it is an active choice of faith: to give glory to God for all the good. By doing so, we participate in His joy and allow His presence to fill our hearts, no matter the circumstance.


*Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good;* <br>
*Blessed is the man who trusts in Him!*<br>
*Psalm 34: 8*
