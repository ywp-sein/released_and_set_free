# Good Actor
A good actor: carefully read the script, deeply understand the story, and faithfully perform the story.

In life’s performance, we are meant to act according to the playwright’s intention.
What we are given is the perfect script.
Yet we are all bad actors with poor skills,
and our performance is full of contradictions and disharmony.

Thankfully,
the playwright’s perfect script comes with a director who personally teaches us to understand the story,
who personally coaches our acting so that we can become good actors,
and even appoints the flawless leading man as the hero to rescue the otherwise terrible play,
while also letting us learn from him how to act.
I believe,
without these things that make us good actors,
we would not be worthy to attend the grand celebration banquet after the performance.

Perhaps some already know,
the playwright is our Father God,
the director is the Holy Spirit who guides us,
and the flawless leading man is, of course, our Savior Christ.
None can be missing.
From reading the script (the Bible) to the final act, they are with us throughout.

Improvisation, of course, is not allowed,
because the script itself is perfect.
Improvising only ruins the story
and may even negatively affect the other actors.
Some may ask:
why be limited by the framework of the script and the director’s instructions?
I would simply say:
acting this way ensures we can become good actors who win the Oscar,
(yes, good actors are among the lead cast).
So why not?

I am already looking forward to the end of the performance,
to celebrate together with all the good actors and with our God at the grand banquet.
I hope your name will also be listed in the end credits,
and I pray I may see you at the celebration feast.
