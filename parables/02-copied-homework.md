# Copied Homework

Perhaps in our school years, we all encountered classmates who copied homework.
These classmates, since they didn’t do their work properly, resorted to shortcuts by copying,
and sometimes, they even caused a few funny incidents.

For example:
copying an answer but accidentally skipping a question, which made everything afterward wrong;<br>
copying the wrong section;<br>
copying from a notebook that wasn’t even theirs;<br>
and so on.

In our lives, the “homework” we face often seems quite similar.
When problems arise,<br>
sometimes we misunderstand God’s will at one step, causing everything after that to go wrong;<br>
sometimes we apply the Lord’s word to the wrong situation;<br>
sometimes the one handling the issue wasn’t supposed to be us at all;
and so forth.

It feels as though in life there are many assignments that our Heavenly Father gives us.
No matter what form the homework takes,
it is important to figure out what the assignment actually is,<br>
to figure out the proper scope of the assignment,<br>
to figure out whether the assignment is even meant for us.<br>
Perhaps these are the questions we should consider before we even start working on the answers.

But in the end, the form, the scope, and the recipient of the assignment are secondary.
Because in reality, our life only has one assignment:
to constantly ask the One who sets the questions—our God.
To ask the One who not only gives the assignments but also provides the answers.
And those answers can never be wrong.

When I thought about it, I realized—this really is a “cheating life” (in the best sense).
If we keep asking the One who sets the questions, we’ll always get the answers.
It couldn’t be easier or more joyful.
