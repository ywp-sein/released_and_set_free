# Exposing Self-Centered Teachings

Nowadays, there are plenty of self-centered teachings that appeal to personal ambition and feelings. These are not the Gospel message at all; even worse, they distort the truth. Denying ourselves and following Him with the cross is the very core of the Gospel. Otherwise, people use their own lens to judge good and evil, which is what happened in the Garden of Eden in the beginning, creating their own version of God based on their own understanding.

Adding extra requirements or relying on our own efforts is not the Gospel—we are saved by grace alone. And biblically, “if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed”.

How can we know we have the true Gospel with confidence and not something false? The key is to empty ourselves, denying our pride and self-will. The enemy always seeks to provoke pride in the flesh, but when we have emptied ourselves, there is nothing left to be triggered.

As we surrender, He perfects our faith—in Him, and in Him alone—leaving no room for pride. Saying “May His will be done” is an act of surrender: praying directly to God, one on One, and submitting our will to His.

After all, His will is always accomplished.

Nowadays, there are plenty of self-centered teachings that appeal to personal ambition and feelings. These are not the Gospel message at all; even worse, they distort the truth. Denying ourselves and following Him with the cross is the very core of the Gospel (Matthew 16:24). Otherwise, people use their own lens to judge good and evil, which is what happened in the Garden of Eden in the beginning (Genesis 3:6), creating their own version of God based on their own understanding.

Adding extra requirements or relying on our own efforts is not the Gospel—we are saved by grace alone (Ephesians 2:8-9). And biblically, “if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed” (Galatians 1:9).

How can we know we have the true Gospel with confidence and not something false? The key is to empty ourselves, denying our pride and self-will. The enemy always seeks to provoke pride in the flesh (James 4:6; Proverbs 16:18), but when we have emptied ourselves, there is nothing left to be triggered.

As we surrender, He perfects our faith—in Him, and in Him alone—leaving no room for pride (Hebrews 12:2; Philippians 1:6). Saying “May His will be done” is an act of surrender: praying directly to God, one on One, and submitting our will to His (Matthew 6:10; Luke 22:42).

After all, His will is always accomplished.
