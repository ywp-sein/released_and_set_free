# The Power of True Repentance

In genuine repentance, shame and guilt are replaced because the focus shifts from what I have done to what God has done for me. There is no need to hide, but rather to boast in the power of His forgiveness. If one still hides and covers, repentance has not truly taken place.

Unrepentance is a curse; repentance is a blessing.

When we turn to Him, we are no longer trapped in self-condemnation — the heart stands in awe of His mercy, breathes the relief of being forgiven, and rejoices in the joy of being restored.

In genuine repentance, shame and guilt are replaced because the focus shifts from what I have done to what God has done for me (Ephesians 2:4–5). There is no need to hide, but rather to boast in the power of His forgiveness (2 Corinthians 12:9). If one still hides and covers, repentance has not truly taken place (Proverbs 28:13).

Unrepentance is a curse; repentance is a blessing (Acts 3:19).

When we turn to Him, we are no longer trapped in self-condemnation (Romans 8:1) — the heart stands in awe of His mercy (Psalm 103:10–12), breathes the relief of being forgiven (1 John 1:9), and rejoices in the joy of being restored (Luke 15:7).
