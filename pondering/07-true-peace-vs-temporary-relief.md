# True Peace vs. Temporary Relief

Increasing peace shows that we are walking with God continually.

Pursuing temporary relief is not true peace; it is like a drug that must be sought again and again, leading only to bondage.

Why does this happen? Because some only want to escape their situationâ€”they do not truly want Jesus, the One who gives real peace. They want freedom from trouble, not the Lord Himself.
